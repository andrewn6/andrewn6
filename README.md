hey, I'm Andrew

I'm currently working on automating supply-chain.

On the side, I'm interested in ML, distributed & low-level systems.

Currently learning about Verilog, FPGA's & learning how to write Zig.

Previously
- Dimension.dev -- Rust and Go, build internal container orchestrtation service.
- UtopiaLabs.com -- TypeScript, built their off-ramp system for USDC -> ACH -- processed 500K in monthly transactions on the platform.

Write alot of Go, Python, sometimes Rust.
